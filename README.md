# Norma Syllabarum Graecarum - A Benchmark for grc Syllabification and Weight Labelling

We introduce NSG as a common benchmark for the evaluation and comparison of NLP tools concerning the markup of prosodical features of Ancient Greek (*grc*) corpora. Three prosodical features are marked up explicitly: syllable boundary, syllable weight and vowel length. Derivately, this means that sandhi phenomena and, for verse, metre are also covered.

Short excerpts from:
- Homer (*Hymn to Hercules*)
- Alcman
- Aristophanes (*Acharnenses*)
- Sophocles (*Supplices*)
- Aeschylus
- Euripides (*Bacchae*)
- Plato (*Cratylus*)
- Thucydides
- Xenophon (*Anabasis*)
- Plutarch
- Epictetus
- Origenes
- Nonnus
